# Brainharmonic - Generating music from brain signal data using deep learning
## Description
This project aims to develop a tool to generate music from brain signals using deep learning models. There has been a lot of work on generating new music from a large collection of music using deep AI models, as well as some work on generating music from brain EEG/fMRI signal through algorithmic or rule based approaches. However there has not been work done on using deep learning models to generate music from EEG/fMRI signal.

In this project, we will use deep generative models to allow EEG/fMRI data to be used as an input to generate music. We will also look into linking brain signal from different regions of the brain to different instruments to create a symphony. More details of the design can be found on our Github page.
